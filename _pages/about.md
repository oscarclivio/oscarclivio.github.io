I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in the [StatML CDT](https://statml.io/) programme, under the supervision of [Chris Holmes](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/people/chris-holmes) in the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford, and with generous funding from [Novo Nordisk](https://www.novonordisk.com/). My research interests revolve around causal inference, especially in high-dimensional datasets. This includes learning suitable representations for [matching](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v151/clivio22a.html), [weighting](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=KNgBCZXJkY), and [overlap](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=I7Uibi1AMt). I have also done work exploring [links between causal treatment effects and Shapley values](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ter-minassian23a.html), and [evaluating causal reasoning in large language models](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=mRwgczYZFJ).

Further, in the summer of 2022, I interned in the Safety and Insurance team at Uber in San Francisco. In the spring of 2024, I visited [Avi Feller](https://www.avifeller.com/) at UC Berkeley. In the summer and fall of 2024, I will be interning at ServiceNow Research and Mila in Montréal.

Previously, I worked at [Immunai](https://www.immunai.com/) as a [research](https://regier.stat.lsa.umich.edu/assets/pdf/clivio2020cell.pdf) engineer. This followed previous master's thesis research on [variational autoencoders to solve problems in single-cell biological data](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/794875v3). This work was also incorporated in a [popular Python package in the field](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-01206-w). 

News
======
- July-November 2024 : I am currently interning at ServiceNow Research with [Alexandre Drouin](https://www.alexdrouin.com/) and Mila with [Ioannis Mitliagkas](https://mitliagkas.github.io/), working on causal discovery and large language models. Feel free to ping me if you want to chat in Montréal!
- January-May 2024 : I have been visiting [Avi Feller](https://www.avifeller.com/) at UC Berkeley. Meanwhile, our [paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=KNgBCZXJkY) on learning representations for balancing weights has been accepted to both UAI 2024 as a poster and ACIC 2024 as an oral presentation. I was also awarded a $500 travel scholarship for this conference.
- December 2023 : Our critical review of benchmarks for assessing causal reasoning in large language models has been accepted for an oral presentation at the ["Are Large Language Models Simply Causal Parrots?"](https://llmcp.cause-lab.net/llmcp) workshop at AAAI 2024. See you in Vancouver!
- October 2023 : I will be attending the [Extending Inferences to a New Target Population](https://icerm.brown.edu/events/htw-23-eintp/) workshop at ICERM, Brown University, on November 17-19.
- October 2023 : our latest work on learning representations for balancing weights has been accepted to the [causal representation learning workshop](https://crl-workshop.github.io/) at NeurIPS 2023! The manuscript is to be uploaded after incorporating feedback from reviewers and other people.
- October 2023 : my J-1 visa application has been approved! I will be visiting [Avi Feller](https://www.avifeller.com/) in UC Berkeley from January to May 2024.
